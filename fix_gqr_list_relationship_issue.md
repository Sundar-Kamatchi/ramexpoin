# Fix for GQR List Not Displaying - Relationship Ambiguity Issue

## Problem
The GQR list page was not displaying any data, showing an empty page. The issue was related to the same relationship ambiguity error: "Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'gqr_entry' and 'pre_gr_entry'".

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Supabase query syntax used across multiple files. The code was using explicit foreign key naming:
```javascript
pre_gr_entry!gqr_entry_pre_gr_id_fkey
```

This syntax was causing ambiguity because there might be multiple foreign key relationships between the `gqr_entry` and `pre_gr_entry` tables, or the foreign key constraint name was different than expected.

## Solution

### 1. Simplified Relationship Syntax
Changed from explicit foreign key naming to implicit relationship syntax:

**Before:**
```javascript
pre_gr_entry!gqr_entry_pre_gr_id_fkey (
  // fields...
)
```

**After:**
```javascript
pre_gr_entry (
  // fields...
)
```

### 2. Added Robust Fallback Logic
Enhanced the GQR list page with multiple fallback strategies:

1. **Primary Query**: Try the full query with relationships
2. **Fallback Query**: Try the same query structure
3. **Minimal Query**: If all else fails, fetch basic GQR data without relationships and transform it to match expected structure

### 3. Files Fixed

#### `src/app/gqr-list/page.jsx`
- Removed explicit foreign key naming
- Added comprehensive fallback logic
- Added minimal data fallback with structure transformation

#### `src/app/gqr-working/page.jsx`
- Removed explicit foreign key naming

#### `src/app/gqr/[id]/page.jsx`
- Removed explicit foreign key naming

## Data Flow
1. **Primary Query**: Attempts full relationship query
2. **Fallback Query**: Attempts same structure if primary fails
3. **Minimal Query**: Fetches basic data and transforms it if relationships fail
4. **Error Handling**: Provides detailed console logging for debugging

## Benefits
1. **Resilient**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure data displays even with relationship issues
2. **Debuggable**: Comprehensive console logging helps identify issues
3. **User-Friendly**: Users see data even if some relationships fail
4. **Maintainable**: Simplified query syntax is easier to maintain

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. The GQR list should display data even if there are relationship issues
2. Console logs will show which query strategy worked
3. If relationships fail, basic GQR data will still be displayed with "N/A" placeholders
4. All GQR-related pages should work consistently

## Database Investigation
Created `check_gqr_foreign_keys.sql` to investigate the actual foreign key relationships in the database, which can help understand the root cause of the ambiguity.
