# Complete GQR Relationship Fix Summary

## Problem
Multiple GQR pages were showing the error:
```
PGRST201: Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'gqr_entry' and 'pre_gr_entry'
```

This error was occurring in:
- GQR List page (`/gqr-list`)
- GQR Edit page (`/gqr/[id]`)
- GQR Working page (`/gqr-working`)

## Root Cause
The database has multiple foreign key relationships between `gqr_entry` and `pre_gr_entry` tables, causing Supabase to be unable to determine which relationship to use when using implicit syntax like `pre_gr_entry()`.

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. GQR List Page (`src/app/gqr-list/page.jsx`)
**Applied comprehensive multi-strategy approach:**
- Multiple relationship attempts with different foreign key specifications
- Separate queries fallback with JavaScript data joining
- Enhanced error logging and debugging

### 2. GQR Edit Page (`src/app/gqr/[id]/page.jsx`)
**Applied multiple relationship attempts:**
- `pre_gr_entry!pre_gr_entry_id_fkey`
- `pre_gr_entry!gqr_entry_pre_gr_id_fkey`
- `pre_gr_entry()` (implicit)

### 3. GQR Working Page (`src/app/gqr-working/page.jsx`)
**Applied multiple relationship attempts:**
- Same three-strategy approach as GQR Edit page
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Strategy Details

### Primary Strategy: Multiple Relationship Attempts
Each page now tries different foreign key specifications in order:

1. **`pre_gr_entry!pre_gr_entry_id_fkey`** - Most common naming convention
2. **`pre_gr_entry!gqr_entry_pre_gr_id_fkey`** - Alternative naming convention
3. **`pre_gr_entry()`** - Implicit relationship (original approach)

### Fallback Strategy: Separate Queries (GQR List Only)
If all relationship attempts fail, the GQR list page falls back to:
1. Fetch GQR entries separately
2. Fetch Pre-GR entries separately
3. Join data in JavaScript

## Code Pattern Applied

```javascript
// Try with pre_gr_entry_id_fkey first
const result1 = await supabase.from('gqr_entry').select(`
  // ... fields ...
  pre_gr_entry!pre_gr_entry_id_fkey (
    // ... nested fields ...
  )
`).eq('id', gqrId).single();

if (result1.error) {
  // Try with gqr_entry_pre_gr_id_fkey
  const result2 = await supabase.from('gqr_entry').select(`
    // ... same structure with gqr_entry_pre_gr_id_fkey ...
  `).eq('id', gqrId).single();
  
  if (result2.error) {
    // Try without explicit foreign key naming
    const result3 = await supabase.from('gqr_entry').select(`
      // ... same structure without foreign key specification ...
    `).eq('id', gqrId).single();
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilient**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure data loads
2. **Debuggable**: Comprehensive logging shows which approach worked
3. **Consistent**: Same pattern applied across all GQR pages
4. **User-Friendly**: Users see data regardless of relationship configuration
5. **Maintainable**: Clear error handling and logging

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
1. **GQR List**: Should load successfully with comprehensive fallback strategies
2. **GQR Edit**: Should load GQR details with proper relationship data
3. **GQR Working**: Should load GQR data for working operations
4. **Console Logs**: Will show which relationship specification worked
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if relationships still fail

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] GQR List page loads and displays entries
- [ ] GQR Edit page loads with proper PO number display
- [ ] GQR Working page loads GQR data successfully
- [ ] Console logs show which relationship approach succeeded
- [ ] No more "multiple relationship found" errors
- [ ] PO numbers display correctly in all pages

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/gqr-list/page.jsx` - Comprehensive multi-strategy approach
2. `src/app/gqr/[id]/page.jsx` - Multiple relationship attempts
3. `src/app/gqr-working/page.jsx` - Multiple relationship attempts

## Database Investigation

Created `check_gqr_foreign_keys.sql` to investigate the actual foreign key relationships, which can help understand the root cause and optimize the relationship specifications.

## Next Steps

1. Test all GQR pages to ensure they load successfully
2. Check console logs to see which relationship specification works
3. If needed, run the foreign key investigation SQL to understand the exact relationship structure
4. Consider updating the database schema to have clearer, single relationships if multiple relationships are causing confusion
