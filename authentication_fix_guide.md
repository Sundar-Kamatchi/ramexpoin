# Authentication Error Fix Guide

## Problem Summary
The authentication error in the PO page is caused by RLS (Row Level Security) policy issues in the `user_profiles` table. The `checkadminstatus` function and authentication provider are failing due to circular dependency in the RLS policies.

## Root Cause
1. **Circular Dependency**: The RLS policy for admin access was checking if the user is an admin by querying the `user_profiles` table, but the same policies control access to that table.
2. **Missing User Profiles**: Some users might not have profile records, causing authentication failures.
3. **RLS Policy Restrictions**: The policies were too restrictive for basic authentication checks.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Fix RLS Policies (Database Level)
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Drop the problematic admin-only view policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON public.user_profiles;

-- Create a new policy that allows authenticated users to view profiles
-- This removes the circular dependency issue
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles" ON public.user_profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Ensure the table has RLS enabled
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. Updated Code Changes
The following files have been updated to handle authentication errors gracefully:

#### AuthProvider.jsx
- Added error handling for missing user profiles
- Automatic profile creation for new users
- Graceful fallback to non-admin status

#### GQR Working Page
- Improved `checkadminstatus` function with better error handling
- Automatic profile creation if missing
- Better logging for debugging

### 3. Testing the Fix
1. Apply the SQL changes to your Supabase database
2. Restart your Next.js development server
3. Try accessing the PO page
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

### 4. Verification
- Users should be able to access the PO page without authentication errors
- Admin status should be properly detected
- Missing user profiles should be automatically created

## Additional Notes
- The fix maintains security while allowing proper authentication flow
- Admin privileges are still properly controlled
- New users will automatically get a 'staff' role by default
- All existing functionality should work as expected

## If Issues Persist
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the SQL changes were applied successfully
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Check Supabase logs for any RLS policy violations
